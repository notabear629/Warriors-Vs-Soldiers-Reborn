#Please pay close attention to instructions when creating new theme classes.
#When creating new themes, you should only be trying to make COSMETIC changes. To truly add more roles or functionality to the game, you will need to do a lot more than change the theme.
#However, if you do create a new role, you will have to give them a theme in any themes you are using.
